### Hi there, my name is Tuyen Le Chi - aka hocj2me 👋 
I'm 22 and living in Hanoi - the capital of Vietnam, I'm studing as electronics technician :books: at Hanoi University Of Science and Technology.<br>
I'm an IT and electronics enthusiast ♐, I speak Vietnamese (native) vie, English (intermediate).<br>
I really like working with Python :snake: and HTML/CSS/JS :spider_web:. I also like playing around with Arduino, C, C++ 🏗️.<br>
My main project (which I'm kinda proud of 😎) is [AirSENSE](https://github.com/Air-SENSE) - an air quality meter project - you can check it out and other my projects in my repositories if you have some free time :smiley:
